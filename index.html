        <p>We are the ethical coding team aka ethical hackers. We fix anything by hacking it like, when we are in trouble (or someone is in trouble) we fix it by hacking/coding. The creator of this team is ME! My name is Aaroosh! Also, some of my friends are in this team. Tashreef, Salman etc. We are muslims that's why the names are like this. At the first place, you might be thinking "What?! Electronic Coders!??!" haha, it isn't electronic, it is ethical.</p>
